### 📊 Data Flow Architecture

![Data Flow Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=ZAHAAM+Data+Flow)

ZAHAAM implements a resilient data architecture designed for reliability and performance:

1. **Data Collection**: Real-time stock data is fetched from Yahoo Finance API at regular intervals
2. **Data Storage**: All fetched data is immediately stored in our database
3. **Data Distribution**: Frontend applications retrieve data from our database, not directly from external APIs
4. **Failover Mechanism**: If API calls fail or hit rate limits, the system automatically falls back to the most recently stored data
5. **Cache Layer**: Frequently accessed data is cached to improve performance

This architecture ensures:
- **Reliability**: Even if external APIs are unavailable, users still have access to data
- **Performance**: Multiple users don't trigger redundant API calls
- **Compliance**: Better control over API rate limits
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent data across all platform features
